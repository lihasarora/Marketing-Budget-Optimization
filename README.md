Project 1 – Linear Programming

Deliverables
One well-written pdf file and one Python code file (.py or .ipynb), submitted to Canvas. Your report should go into some detail about how you solved the problem, include some graphs that explain your results, and include relevant code chunks in the final output. Your report can be created by taking screenshots of the code/graph and assembling it in a word document, then export as a pdf file. 


Problem Description
Marketing budgets now comprise 11 percent of total company budgets, based on a CMO survey sponsored by the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, Deloitte LLP, and the American Marketing Association. However, the effectiveness of marketing varies significantly: on the one hand, P&G cut more than $100 million in digital marketing spending because their digital ads were largely ineffective; on the other hand, Netflix plans a 54% boost in ad spending because they got very positive feedback in international markets.

One potential reason for such variation is the way of making marketing budget allocations. Namely, how much to invest in each advertisement platform. As stated in the Handbook of Marketing Analytics:

...budget decisions are often based on gut feelings or on the negotiation skills of individual managers. Consequently, politics and individual opinions tend to shape the decision process instead of fact-based discussions. Obviously, these rules and practices bear the risk of results far away from the optimal, profit-maximizing budget.

Indeed, the marketing strategy of Netflix seems to be steered by data.
